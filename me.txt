Computer programming (also known as coding) is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks.
Programmable devices have existed for centuries or even more.
The first computer program is normally dated to 1843 when the mathematician Lady Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.
